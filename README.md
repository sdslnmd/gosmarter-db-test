Test First Development
======================

In this blog I will demonstrate designing a usecase with Test First Development approach. Let me explain the usecase first, we need to write an application, where we need to recommend a user some products based on his past purchase history, in which he has similar brands. Get the working code from Github.

If you see in the above usecase, there are 3 objects, User, Item object, and UserItemPurchaseHistory. Refer @ http://wp.me/p2oZRH-7u
